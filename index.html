                <p class="bio">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My Name is Manuel Savino, I graduated from FIU with a Bachelors in Information Technology. I currently work at the FIU Herbert
                Wertheim College of Medicine as a Clinical IT Field Analyst 2. I'm currently enrolled in the University of Miami Full Stack
                Web Development bootcamp. I've always had a passion for web development, with the help of the web, I've tought myself some
                HTML, CSS, PHP and some Javascript.
                </p> 
                <p class="bio">On my free time I like to produce videos of anything that comes my way. Whether it be
                Marketing videos for a store for their website, or just flying my drone creating cinematic views of Miami. As an addition
                that goes hand in hand with the production of them, I've started to make motion graphics animations on Adobe After Effects.
